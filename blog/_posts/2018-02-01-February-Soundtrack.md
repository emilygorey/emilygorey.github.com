<h2>February Soundtrack</h2>

In a wildly precedent and predictable fashion, the February Soundtrack is centered around love. Surprisingly, it’s not too hard to find a song or two on the topic. I set myself up for success with this one.

Since the previous February, I have had the undoubtable luck of falling in love again. These songs have a loose following of how I felt last February to how I feel now. The order of the playlist is intentional and a tribute to a year of a lot of emotions. February 2017 Emily was definitely in an anti-Valentine’s Day kind of mood. The beginning of the playlist is for her. The rest was for what was to come.   

A month later, she’d be introduced to a boy in a Neutral Milk Hotel* shirt who would change her life through the introduction of Indian food, cyberpunk films, and Mexico. What a total babe of a person. February 2018 Emily is still obsessed.

<em>*I have a major soft spot for Neutral Milk Hotel. please see final song of playlist performed by the singer of the band, Jeff Mangum</em>
